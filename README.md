# Vim Config
A script to configure my Vim environment, along with necessary files

## TODO: Add steps for filetype.vim

## install.sh
Even with comments, sometimes it's hard to understand what's going on in bash
scripts, especially if you're new to bash or Vim. I know I had to spend some time figuring
out what was going on. Here's what's happening:

1. Set a flag to force the script to exit immediately if it encounters an error.
2. Create directories where files are going to be installed.
3. Copy the colorscheme files (colors/\*.vim) to the colors directory we just made (~/.vim/colors).
4. Install Vundle, the Vim package manager I like to use. We clone (copy) it from Github.
5. Copy the contents of .vimrc (the configuration file where a lot of the magic happens) to its home (~/.vim).
6. Open Vim, call `:PluginInstall`, which installs all of our plugins, then quit Vim.
7. Install fonts that have been patched and adjusted to work with the "Powerline" plugin.
   + At this point we follow the instructions from the Powerline plugin.
8. Lastly, we remind ourselves that the fonts _are_ installed, but the symbols won't appear until
   we select one in whatever terminal we are using.

## colors
I'm currently happy with Brogrammer, a colorscheme I was using when I coded with Sublime
Text 2. I found [vim-brogrammer-theme] and modified it slightly. Here are the changes I made:
+ Comment changed from ![#626262][comment-original] to ![#9e9e9e][comment-new]
+ NonText changed from ![#0000ff][nontext-original] to ![#ff0087][nontext-new]
+ SpecialKey changed from ![#0000ff][specialkey-original] to ![#0087ff][specialkey-new]
+ Number changed from ![5f5fd7][number-original] to ![ffaf5f][number-new]

## .vimrc
### Layout
My .vimrc follows this basic layout:
1. [Settings](https://github.com/jkclark/Vim-Setup/blob/master/.vimrc#L8)
2. [Mappings](https://github.com/jkclark/Vim-Setup/blob/master/.vimrc#L102)
3. [Plugins](https://github.com/jkclark/Vim-Setup/blob/master/.vimrc#L136)

### Settings
Many of the settings in .vimrc were taken from [nvie's .vimrc](https://github.com/nvie/vimrc/blob/master/vimrc).
You can look up any individual setting and find out more about what it does. Some settings worth mentioning:
+ `set list`: Show invisible characters by default. Some people might not like this. I find that it makes me
pay more attention to indenting and style than I normally would. It also helps me compare indentation levels
of lines that are far apart.
+ `set cmdheight=2`: Show a status bar that is 2 lines high. This way, nothing gets inadvertently covered up
by vim-airline.

### Mappings
The mappings are pretty self-explanatory. Most of them have comments explaining what they do.

### Plugins
